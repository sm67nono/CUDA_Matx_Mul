After v1.0 in 2D

1. Check Performance by CUDA streams. Pinned memory from Host.

Commit it to a seperate version

2. Add P2P excahnges transfers and performance.

Commit it to a seperate version

3. Add zero copy host memory and check for performance.

Repeat the same in 3D


1. Performance evaluation using just Memcpy for Halos. not MemcpyAsync

2. Performance evaluation for kernel launches on default streams for each device. (Check concurrent kernal launches)

3. Performance evaluation for non pinned Halos vs Pinend Halos.

4. Perforamnce evaluation for p2p transfers.





------------------------Performance Optimization hierarchy-----------Optimize Phase 1 - Done-------


1. Synchronous Memcpies for results. Synchronous Memcpies for Halos. Synchronous memcopies for result copied from GPU(Vec_In).

2. Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Synchronous Memcpies for Halos. Synchronous memcopies for result copied from GPU(Vec_In, VecOut). (using streams)

3. Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Synchronous Memcpies for Halos. Asynchronous memcopies for result copied from GPU(Vec_In, VecOut). (using streams)

4. Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Synchronous Memcpies for Halos. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). (using streams)

5. Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Asynchronous Memcpies for Halos. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). (using streams)

6. Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Asynchronous Memcpies for Halos. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). (using streams)

7.  Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Asynchronous Memcpies for Halos. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). Kernal launhes concurrently (using streams)


------------------------Performance Optimization hierarchy-----------Optimize Phase 2 - Done-------


8.  Asynchronous Memcpies for results. P2P exchange for Halos. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). Kernal launhes concurrently (using streams)

9.  Asynchronous Memcpies for results. P2P exchange for Halos using Hardware underlying topology. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). Kernal launhes concurrently (using streams)

------------------------Performance Optimization hierarchy-----------Optimize Phase 3 - Done-------

10. Asynchronous Memcpies for results. Single host thread per device(using OpenMP) P2P exchange for Halos. swap pointers on Host GPU(Vec_In and Vec_out). Kernal launhes concurrently (using streams).
11. Use seperate read/Write buffer for exchanging halos to the above version.
